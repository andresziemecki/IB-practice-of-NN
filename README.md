# Practical exercise of the subject Neural Network of the Balseiro Institute  
  
Here are 7 good exercises for starting with Neural Network using Keras.  
  
These exercises starts with an easy problem as a training of an XOR gate.  
  
Then, next exercises will grow in difficulty finalizing with a Cat-Dog Classification using Convolutinal Neural Networks.
  
The dataset of cats/dogs images you can find it here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data
